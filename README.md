# MEC Attendance

This app allows students of Government Model Engineering College to check their attendance and timetable (and also the number of classes they can safely cut).

It is available for download on Google Play.

Feel free to use this code to adapt it for any other purpose. :)

# Running the App

Cloning the app and running it directly will not work as the signing keys have been added to gitignore. In order to run the app on your device follow the below steps :

1. Create a new Flutter project.
2. Replace the folders 'lib' and 'assets' and the file pubsecs.yaml of the new project with the ones in this repository.
3. Run the app. (Make changes to test folder if it shows error).
